"The United States is home to over <a href='http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_10.html'>\
160,000 miles</a> of pipelines that carry crude oil \
and other petroleum products - enough to reach from New York City to Los Angeles more than 40 times!<br><br>\
These pipelines carried about 16.2 billion barrels of oil/petroleum products in 2014, \
a number that has increased rapidly in recent years. The Association of Oil Pipe \
Lines <a href='http://www.api.org/~/media/Files/Oil-and-Natural-Gas/pipeline/Whats-New/2015-AOPL-API-Pipeline-Usage-Mileage-Report.pdf'>\
reports</a> that between 2010 and 2015, crude oil pipeline mileage increased 22% \
(an addition of over 12,000 miles). From 2013 to 2014 alone, crude oil delivery \
through US transmission pipelines increased 11.6%. A variety of factors have\
 caused crude oil prices to drop in the past two years, which has decreased the \
growth of US production.<br><br>\
Pipelines are celebrated as the safest, most reliable and efficient method to \
transport energy liquids - and with good reason - but spills and leaks do happen, \
and they have real consequences that we don't always hear about. In most cases, \
operators are required to submit incident reports to PHMSA, the US Department of \
Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Since January \
2010, operators filed over 2,600 such reports; that averages to more than one per day. \
The reports include over $2.2 billion in damages, 7 fatalities and 15 injuries, \
and details about damage to local communities and ecosystems.<br><br>\
This map is designed to help us picture the contents of those incident reports.",

// Regionally Silo: 1 (out)
"Our relationship with pipelines is geographically based. Even pipeline accidents \
and construction that become locally or regionally important rarely become national \
news - that is, unless the incident causes gas prices to increase. While it is true \
that incidents mostly tend to impact nearby communities and ecosystems, understanding \
individual incidents helps us recognize the patterns that emerge across the country.<br><br>\
Let's start in Montana, where a crude oil spill in 2011 received some national attention \
because of its proximity to Yellowstone National Park.",

	<br><br>  On July 1, 2011, a girth weld on the Silvertip pipeline failed at a crossing \
	of the Yellowstone River due to river flooding. <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportation-proposes-17-million-civil-penalties-exxonmobil">\
	PHMSA alleged</a> that Exxon Mobil was aware of the pressure on the aging pipeline \
	caused by seasonal flooding and failed to take action to mitigate that risk.<br><br> \
	  Over 63,000 gallons (1,509 barrels) of crude oil leaked into the sensitive river ecosystem. \
	Clean up operations included over 1,000 Exxon Mobil personnel. \
	As of September 2016, the company \
	<a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2016/09/21/latest-exxon-to-pay-12m-for-yellowstone-oil-spill.html">\

// Waterways: 3 (out)
"Spills in waterways can be especially damaging because water can spread pipeline \
contents quickly and complicate clean up. The effects of spills in waterways not \
only impact the environment, but can pose real threats to the communities that rely \
on them for drinking water and industry.<br><br>\
Two years ago, a spill about 3 times larger than the one we just saw in the \
Yellowstone River sent barrels of crude oil down a Louisiana river into a protected \
wetland. Although the extent to which recovery efforts were able to mitigate damage \
to the ecosystem is still being monitored, let's fly south.",

// Eminent Domain: 5 (out)
"If you're wondering why they don't just build the pipelines somewhere safer, the \
answer is, 'they do' - or at least they try to. Pipeline construction projects are \
required to identify locations where risks are more significant - they're labeled 'High \
Consequence Areas,' or HCAs, because damage caused by a spill or leak could pose a \
larger threat to people and ecosystems. Incident reports are required to indicate \
whether a spill reached an HCA. <br><br>\
Prioritizing safety and local needs while ensuring a cohesive and profitable route \
can prove to be a balancing act, and land rights add an additional wildcard. Operators \
need to negotiate construction permits with the government at the local, state, and \
federal level as well as make deals with private landowners along the proposed route.<br><br>\
Increasingly, operators rely on eminent domain, which allows the government to require \
private landowners to give up the use of their land (with compensation) for projects \
for the public good. The use of eminent domain specifically for 'economic development' \
is extremely controversial and cannot be justly summarized here, but the \
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London'>Kelo v. City of \
New London Supreme Court case</a> is a good place to start if you are interested.<br><br>\
Our next stop is in Georgia, where a simple mistake by a private landowner led to \
tragedy for his family when he accidentally struck a propane pipeline.",

// Dixie Pipeline Georgia: 6
"<p class='centered'>Pipeline Explosion in McDuffie County, Georgia</p>\
On July 5th, 2010, a Paul McCorkle and his adult son Jason used a bulldozer to work on their property. \
The machinery accientally struck and ruptured a <a href='http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/PipelineFailureReports/Dixie_HL_GA_20100705.pdf'>\
8-inch propane pipeline</a>, causing propane to escape. After some time, the released \
propane ignited, causing an explosion at the pipeline break. This explosion tragically \
killed the son and <a href='http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/metro/2010-07-05/fiery-pipeline-blast-kills-man'>\
ignited a brushfire on the property</a>.<br><br>\
The McDuffie County Fire Chief and other agencies did not have any record of the McCorkle \
calling to check before digging - which is required 48 hours in advance - but noted \
that third-party hits like this are a common cause of pipeline incidents. With the \
vast majority of pipelines buried undergroud, it can be difficult for private landowners \
to be aware of their precise placement.<br>",

// Minor Stuff: 7 (out?)
"Finding a balance between the priorities of residents, corporation, ecosystems, and \
consumers is difficult. We've just looked at three places where the impact of a pipeline \
incident was obvious - but about half of the reports contain incidents where one barrel \
or less was leaked. <br><br> \
As isolated incidents, these small accidents probably aren't a big deal. They're certainly not front \
page worthy. <br><br> \
However, what they represent on aggregate is a big deal. Pipelines leak every day. \
Accidents happen everywhere. Reliable inspection and maintenance can reduce the \
likelihood of accidents and effective protocols can mitigate the damage, but we need \
to be able to have conversations about what risks are acceptable.",

<br>Like all tough conversations, ensuring there is space at the table for everyone \
is a challenge of its own. Right now in North Dakota, an <a href='https://nodaplsolidarity.org/'>\
indigenous led movement </a> is challenging the construction of a large crude oil \
pipeline near the Standing Rock reservation. <br><br>\
Violence erupted at the end of October when police from five states began to clear \
camps of protesters. <br><br>\
The protesters argue that the US government and the corporation building the pipeline \
(Energy Transfer Partners) failed to appropriately consult with the tribes before \
approving the pipeline's route and did not accurately assess the cultural, spiritual, \
and environmental concerns posed by the proposed construction location. In particular, \
the pipeline would cross the intersection of the Missouri and Cannon Ball rivers, the \
home to the Mandan origin story, as well as burial grounds and Sundance sites. The \
proposed route also crosses the Ogallala Aquifer, a water source for approximately \
18 million people.",

"This map does not, on its own, support or challenge statements about any one pipeline. \
Instead, it is intended to provide access to public data to lend context to these \
difficult but crucial conversations.<br><br>\
As you explore, take a moment to notice patterns in the data and consider the priorities \
and assumptions you bring as an individual. Do your own research, share, ask others \
what they care about.<br><br> \
The state of pipelines in America is rapidly changing and we need everyone's voice."
